## Inspiration
Foodsave is inspired by the NUS Buffet Response Team, a Telegram group that informs the NUS community about available buffet leftovers.
## What it does
Foodsave tracks nearby events created by organisers and shows the availability of leftover food, allowing nearby users to help clear the leftovers and reduce waste.
## How we built it
Foodsave allows event organisers to create and manage events by submitting key details such as date, location, caterer information, dietary restrictions, and allergens, while users can view nearby events in real time and track buffet availability through clear status indicators. By connecting organisers and the public through a simple, location-aware interface, FoodSave encourages timely collection of excess food that would otherwise go to waste.
## Challenges we ran into
A key challenge was designing a system that balances trust, personalisation, and inclusivity. For event organisers, we needed to collect and verify SFA licence numbers to ensure listed caterers are legitimate. The event will then be approved after back-end verification. On the user side, implementing account sign-up and login was necessary to account for diverse dietary restrictions and allergens. It required careful data design and UI considerations, as the information had to be captured accurately and displayed clearly so users could make safe, informed decisions about food consumption.
